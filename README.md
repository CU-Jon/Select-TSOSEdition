A set of PowerShell scripts to assist with selecting and detecting the correct Windows edition during SCCM Task Sequences.

These scripts dynamically set an SCCM Task Sequence variable (`osEdition`) based on user selection or automatic detection using BIOS-embedded product keys (via ShowKeyPlus).

The goal is to allow a single SCCM Task Sequence to intelligently branch and install the correct Windows edition automatically.

Compatible with Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows 10, and Windows 11 deployments.

## üì¶ Contents

- **Select-TSOSEdition.ps1**  
  Script to manually prompt the user to select the Windows edition.

- **Select-TSOSEdition_withAuto.ps1**  
  Script to automatically detect the Windows edition via BIOS OEM key if available, otherwise prompt the user.

- **Select-TSOSEdition_withAuto_TESTING.ps1**  
  Same as Select-TSOSEdition_withAuto.ps1 but with destructive actions (like setting SCCM Task Sequence variables and logging to file) commented out for testing purposes.

---

## üõ† Requirements

- **ShowKeyPlus x64 Version 1.0.7060** is required for edition auto-detection.
- Download from the official GitHub release here:
  [https://github.com/Superfly-Inc/ShowKeyPlus/releases/tag/ShowKeyPlus7060](https://github.com/Superfly-Inc/ShowKeyPlus/releases/tag/ShowKeyPlus7060)

- After downloading:
  - Create a folder named `ShowKeyPlus_x64_1.0.7060` next to the scripts.
  - Place the `ShowKeyPlus.exe` binary directly inside this folder.
  - The folder structure should look like this:

```
Select-TSOSEdition/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Select-TSOSEdition.ps1
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Select-TSOSEdition_withAuto.ps1
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Select-TSOSEdition_withAuto_TESTING.ps1
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ShowKeyPlus_x64_1.0.7060/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ShowKeyPlus.exe
```

‚ö†Ô∏è The folder name `ShowKeyPlus_x64_1.0.7060` is **hardcoded** in the scripts and must match exactly.

## üõ† How It Works

1. Place the three scripts and the ShowKeyPlus_x64_1.0.7060 folder together.

2. Execute the appropriate script during your SCCM Task Sequence:
   - **Select-TSOSEdition.ps1** for manual selection.
   - **Select-TSOSEdition_withAuto.ps1** for automatic detection and fallback to manual selection if needed.

‚ö° **Important:**  
Because Task Sequences run under the SYSTEM account, you must use `ServiceUI.exe` to display the script's UI to the logged-in user.

Example command line inside your Task Sequence step:

```
ServiceUI.exe -process:TSProgressUI.exe powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -WindowStyle Minimized -File "Select-TSOSEdition_withAuto.ps1" -Verbose
```

‚úÖ Adjust the path as needed for your environment.

‚úÖ ServiceUI.exe can be found inside the MDT Toolkit or ConfigMgr MDT integration package under `Tools\x64\` or `Tools\x86\`.

3. The script will set the Task Sequence variable **osEdition** to one of the following values:

| Windows Edition | osEdition Value |
|:---|:---|
| Windows 8/8.1/10/11 Home (Core) | `home` |
| Windows 8/8.1/10/11 Pro | `pro` |
| Windows 8/8.1/10/11 Enterprise | `enterprise` |
| Windows 8/8.1/10/11 Education | `education` |
| Windows 10/11 Pro for Workstations | `prows` |
| Windows 10/11 Pro Education | `proedu` |

4. If the **Select-TSOSEdition_withAuto.ps1** script is used, and the automatically detected edition is selected by the user, the Task Sequence variable **isAutoEdition** will be set to **true**. Otherwise, **false**. This can be handy if you want to add a step to have the client auto-activate with the BIOS key with:
```
cscript.exe "%windir%\System32\slmgr.vbs" /ato
```
Furthermore, if the automatically detected edition is selected, and an OEM Product Key is found, the OEM Key will be stored in the Task Sequence variable **oemKey**. This is handy if for whatever reason Windows doesn't detect the key after installation, you can use:
```
cscript.exe "%windir%\System32\slmgr.vbs" /ipk %oemKey%
```

5. In your Task Sequence:
   - Add **Install Operating System** steps for each edition you want to support.
   - Add a **Condition** on each step:
     - Example:  
       `Task Sequence Variable osEdition equals home`
     - For Pro Edition:  
       `osEdition equals pro`
     - For Enterprise Edition:  
       `osEdition equals enterprise`
     - And so on.

6. This allows a single Task Sequence to handle installing different Windows editions dynamically based on user input or automatic OEM detection.

## üìã Logging and Verbose Output

- **Production scripts** (`Select-TSOSEdition.ps1` and `Select-TSOSEdition_withAuto.ps1`) automatically log output to the Task Sequence log folder (`%_SMSTSLogPath%`).
- The log file name matches the script name, for example:
  - `Select-TSOSEdition_withAuto.ps1` ‚Üí `Select-TSOSEdition_withAuto.log`
  - `Select-TSOSEdition.ps1` ‚Üí `Select-TSOSEdition.log`
- The **TESTING script** (`Select-TSOSEdition_withAuto_TESTING.ps1`) does **not** log to a file (logging code is commented out for safety).

- The TESTING script runs in **Verbose** mode **by default**.
- Production scripts can enable verbose output by running with `-Verbose` at the command line.

Example:

```
ServiceUI.exe -process:TSProgressUI.exe powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -WindowStyle Minimized -File "Select-TSOSEdition_withAuto.ps1" -Verbose
```
